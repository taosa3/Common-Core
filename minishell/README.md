# minishell

## Description

**minishell** is a simplified implementation of a Unix shell, developed as part of the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how shells work internally, including process creation, command parsing, environment management, redirections, and signal handling.

This shell replicates a subset of the behavior of **bash**, allowing the user to execute commands, handle pipes and redirections, manage environment variables, and interact with the system through a command-line interface.

The project emphasizes low-level programming concepts such as:
- Process control (`fork`, `execve`, `wait`)
- File descriptors and redirections
- Signals
- Memory management
- Parsing and lexical analysis

---

## Features

- Display a prompt and wait for user input
- Command execution using absolute or relative paths
- Built-in commands:
  - `echo`
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`)
- Exit status expansion (`$?`)
- Pipes (`|`)
- Redirections:
  - Input (`<`)
  - Output (`>`)
  - Append (`>>`)
  - Heredoc (`<<`)
- Signal handling (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`) similar to bash
- Proper error handling and memory management

---

## Instructions

### Requirements

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)
- `cc`
- `make`
- `readline` library

### Compilation

To compile the project, run:
```bash
 make
```
This will generate the executable:
```bash
./minishell
```
### Execution

Launch minishell by running:
```bash
./minishell
```

You can then start typing commands as you would in a regular shell.

### Usage Examples
```bash
minishell$ echo Hello World

Hello World

minishell$ ls | grep minishell

minishell.c

minishell$ export NAME=42

minishell$ echo $NAME

42

minishell$ cat << EOF
> hello
> minishell
> EOF

hello
minishell

```

## AI Usage

AI tools were used as a support resource during the development of this project, primarily for:

Clarifying the behavior of system calls and signals

Understanding shell-related concepts (pipes, redirections, heredocs)

Improving code structure and readability

Debugging logic errors and edge cases

All design decisions, implementation, and final code were written and validated by the project authors, in compliance with the 42 rules regarding academic integrity.
